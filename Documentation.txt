1. Angular is a component based architecture.
2. what is Angular?
    Angular is frontend framework: Is a collection of HTML, CSS TS. It is a OpenSource and in early it was 
    introduced in JS but then it was then completely  rewritten in OpenSource TypeScript. 
     - Primary Goal of Angular was to develop a Single Page application.
     - Template: Presentation can be expressed by using HTML, 
     - In Angular for every component we have one HTML file. 
     - Angular is maintained by Google. 
     - Initially it was designed for web development and now used also for mobile platforms. 

3. Features :-  
     - Document Object Model (DOM): Everything is treating as object. 
     - TypeScript
     - Data Binding: It allows the user to manipulate. 
        Example: 1. Client is is sending a Data to be store in DB
                 2. Request: Get data from DB: Angular provides One way binding and two way binding.
     - Testing: Angular uses Jasmin framework to run the test cases and another tool is Karma which is a task runner
                for the test cases.
4. Architecture :-
     - MVC:- Model View Controller
       Example:
            View (Client) >>>> Controller >>> Model (Data Related Logic) 
                          <<<             <<< Process the request and send back to Client via Model.
        Model: Object
        View: Presentation
        Controller: Business Logic
    - Architecture is composed of 
                - Module
                - Component: TypeScript Files
                - Template: HTML File
                - Directives: Used to changed the DOM or let say to beautify the web page. 
                - Data Binding: Property Binding and Event Binding 
                - Service(DI Dependencies Injection): They are not imported by the component but explicitly ask to be injected. And a single service for the entire aplpication will be enough.
                - Routing
        NG Model: 
    - Angular Advantages :- 
            - Component can be customized.
            - DI (Dependencies Injection): Services can be injected.
            - Data Binding
            - Testing
            - Out of box thinking
            - Support all types of Browsers

            Limitations:
            - Learning curve steep
            - SEO: Limited
            - Migration

            Companies like: Nike, Google, Forbes, HBO, SONY, GM and more.

            Component: Common featured of COmponent:
            - Building block of your application.
            - Root Component: Even though there are 1000 of component but there will be root component which will have all the information of other component: appComponent:Branches
            - Every component has its own Template, Service, and using some sort of Directives. 
                - Every Template has three diffrent type of Directives:
                    - Component
                    - Structural Directives.
                    - Attribute Directives
                - One Template can have one component or one component can have one Template.
